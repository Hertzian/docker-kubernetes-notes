docker compose is used to start up multiple docker containers at the same time,
automates some of the long-winded arguments we were passing to 'docker run'
also is for in certain way use the docker CLI commands for repetitive tasks

example of the CLI:
docker build -t <docker-id>/<project_name>:<version>
docker run -p 4001:8080 <docker-id>/<project_name>

containers we use in the example after 'services' tag in docker-compose.yml
first of all at the top of the file
version: '3' // is the version of docker-compose to use

-redis-server
  make it using the 'redis' image
-node-app
  make using the Dockerfile in folder 5_...
  map port 4001 from our machine to 8081 in docker container

important note, these commands work in the project folder only
docker run <my-image> 
-docker-compose 'equivalent':
docker-compose up

docker build .
docker rum <my-image>
-docker-compose 'equivalent':
docker-compose up --build

launch in background:
docker-compose up -d

stop containers
docker-compose down

restart policies:
'no'
-never attempt to restart this . container if it stops or crashes, ALWAYS need single or double quotes
in docker-compose file
'always'
-if this container stops *for any reason* always attempt to restart it
'on-failure'
-only restart if the container stops with an error code
'unless-stopped'
-always restart unless we (the devs) forcibly stop it

to see docker-compose running containers:
(only looks for the docker-compose.yml in the working directory containers)
docker-compose ps
